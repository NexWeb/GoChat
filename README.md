# PythonChat, made with GoLang

## What is GoChat and who uses it?
  GoChat is a simple encrypted chat with focus on privacy. This is a free to use service for anyone who needs a private chat between two or more parties.

## How does GoChat work?
  As of latest build we have implemented the [AES][ed562d5e] (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption which is still considered safe as of 2017. The AES 256 bits implementation is a standard that is still in use by the US government for their [top secret documents][813bf0e5]. In a later build we want to implement RSA encryption which essentially is a public-key cryptosystem.
